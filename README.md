# Stellar-Model-of-Alpha-Centauri-B-python-
A python based machine learning code which uses concepts of spherical geometry to construct an approximately spherical star from equal area square and triangular tiles. Each of these tiles have assigned properties (such as relative intensity to observer and individual light curves) which can be sampled and averaged as the model rotates through a cycle. The model was created as a method of investigating the effects of spots and plage (stellar activity forms) on the RV variation in the spectrographic data from HARPS on Alpha Centauri B
